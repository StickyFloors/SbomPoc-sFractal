# SbomPoc
Webserver with status of SBOM Poc

## Setup guide
First ensure you have the following set up in your computer
- elixir 1.10.4
- nodejs > 12 LTS
- Postgresql > 11

You can use [the phoenix installation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#content) to ensure you
have everything set up as expected


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
